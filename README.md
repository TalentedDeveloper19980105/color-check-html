Requirements:
The purpose of the tool is so that users can check the color contrast ratio of multiple colors at once instead of only 2 at a time.
The tool will be a standalone website.
Users enter in hex codes as 6 digits. They can add a comma or press enter on the keyboard after each hex code, and the system will automatically recognize it as a hex code. In other words, the user should not have to enter in a hashtag, although they can if they want to and that should work too. 
The website should be mobile responsive. 
There are no specific frameworks we need to use for this project.
A user should be able to print (save as PDF) the results page, and the PDF should look the same as the design on “color-checker-5”
We will supply a Google analytics code to implement in the code.
